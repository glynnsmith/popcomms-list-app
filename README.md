# PopComms List App

This repo contains my effort of building a technical test for a front-end developer role at PopComms. It is based up the design and prototype found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/p2Dp6hysKfCAGs2ylnyRUG/Front-end-Recruitment-Task-Mid?node-id=134%3A0)

## Installation and Development

Please clone this repo to your local storage and run `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building the App

Once you're ready to build the app, run `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the CRA docs section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
