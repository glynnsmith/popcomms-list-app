# PopComms List App

## The Builds

### The Submitted App

You can view the built project [here](https://popcomms-list-app.vercel.app/).

This repo contains my effort of building a technical test for a front-end developer role at PopComms. It is based up the design and prototype found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/p2Dp6hysKfCAGs2ylnyRUG/Front-end-Recruitment-Task-Mid?node-id=134%3A0).

### Post-Release Issues and Fixes

I've also begun a cheeky list of post-test [issues](https://github.com/glynnsmith/popcomms-list-app/issues), the fixing of which are being chucked onto a second [branch](https://github.com/glynnsmith/popcomms-list-app/tree/post-release-fixes). The build of this branch can be found [here](https://popcomms-list-app-git-post-release-fixes.glynnsmith.vercel.app/).

## The Project

### Installation

Please clone this repo to your local storage, `cd` into that directory, and run `nvm install`.\
This installs the version of node used in the remote repo.

### Development

Once that's completed, you're ready to develop.

Run `nvm use && npm start`

This uses the correct node version, then runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building the App

Once you're ready to build the app, run `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the CRA docs section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
